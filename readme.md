## What is SulfurAI?

SulfurAI is a custom AI platform that helps developers and creators **predict and summarise their userbase**.  

- Predict the growth of your userbase, channel or latest video/ product.
- Ask a custom model about your users, getting insights no other platform offers.
- See all your users easily, and get more than just data.

Fully modular, **built for you**.

## Install

Option 1: Install packages manually via requirements.txt
	- Not recommended since you must manually install them to the .venv 

Option 2: Use the instructions provided when running SulfurAI.py or the INSTALLER
	- Provides custom PowerShell commands for easy install.
