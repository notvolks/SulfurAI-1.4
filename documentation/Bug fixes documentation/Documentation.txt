-Patching the PIP installer:
------------------------------

Sulfur AI currently has an auto-installer that installs all modules.

There was an issue with how the modules were installed and imported (not added to a specific path, module mapping for importing failed).

This was fixed by having it create a new virtual environment, where it installs all the modules and imports them from there.

[There was no code fix available for this patch].
[To replicate fix, please see the SulfurAI-10399d-patch1 branch on GitHub // VersionDATA // depeninstall // python311 // data // pip_dependancy_installer.py]

-Fixing LLama LLM integration and PIP installation:
------------------------------

The PIP installation had an error with how it was installing LLAMA - which needed Microsoft visual studio c++ installed before it.

This was fixed with the newest pip_dependancy_installer.

We also fixed misc bugs concerning how some modules weren't auto-installed.
